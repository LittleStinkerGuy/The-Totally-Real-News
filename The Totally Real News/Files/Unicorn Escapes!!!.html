        <p style="text-indent: 40px">If you remember the Unicorn from our last publishing, you will be very worried to hear this new news. The unicorn has escaped from the prison that it was held captive in. The unicorn escaped when the policemen had to go home because of the Covid-19.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px"> So far, the unicorn has attacked 31 candy stores. 19 in the of those are in the united states. The other 5 in Germany, and 4 in France. though nobody knows why he attacked the last 3 in china during the coronavirus. this has caused the stores to lose even more money because of thefts, and people are freaking out.
            There are also more criminals on the run because of the unicorn. People suspect that the unicorn was mad at the people who put him in jail and started using its powers to free prisoners. These actions have had the police swarming everywhere, looking for all the prisoners. People think that next time they catch the unicorn, they might kill it, or send it to the other side of space on a rocket ship with the books and dictionaries from the first of this trilogy and the unicorn merch mentioned in the second.
