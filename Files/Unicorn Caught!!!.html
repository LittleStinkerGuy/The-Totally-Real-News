        <p style="text-indent: 40px">Rember the unicorn that we mentioned in our last issue? It was Caught! You may recall, the police offered $1,000,000,000 to anybody who had any information on the crime. One person who helped the cops was Dr. Max Carroll, who saw hair next to the mouth of a cave studied it. He realized that it was unicorn hair! The police stocked the cave where the unicorn lived and then followed it to a rainbow lovers festival held every day at Palo Alto and made the arrest. We got to interview the unicorn and couldn't understand anything, but luckily, we could get a professional translator to help us understand the unicorn. The unicorn said that he couldn't help it, but he admits to the crime. Then, we found out that the only reason he did it is that the candy maker that was bought for him by members of the Unicorn-Protecting Society was broken, and unicorns have to have 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 pounds of candy every day! A lot of people want the unicorn not to be arrested and to be put in the zoo! Zoologists say that it's a bad idea because unicorns absorb it energy through their horn and could absorb the energy of the cage and blast it at the weak cage! </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">Did you know that unicorns can’t fly and if they do then they’ll barf candy? The unicorn started as a fierce creature found in the furthest corners of the known world. It had the head of a stag, an elephant's feet, and the tail of boar. But somehow, it turned into a candy-eating soft cuddly horse with a horn. People are profiting from this event. The Tomer and Daniel Shop has unicorn headbands, pajamas, and nail polish. Asos's top sellers are unicorn slippers. At H&M, you can buy a T-shirt for the Unicorn Fan Club. Anyway, the unicorn should be locked in the toughest prison in the world. The End
