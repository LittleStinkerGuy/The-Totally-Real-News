    <p style="text-indent: 40px">Last night the last Unicorn in the world ate all of the candy in existence!!! It is a worldwide catastrophe. Everybody should be on the lookout police are offering 1,000,000,000 dollars for any information on this beast. We are lucky to have access to this photo, as this is the only picture of unicorns in existence. Now that candy is gone, it is being removed from all books and dictionaries. If you have a book or dictionary with the word candy or Unicorn in it, then watch out, you could be arrested. Here is a unicorn story: Once upon a time, there was a beautiful island. In the island meadows, there lived a young fairy named Isotopia. She had a pet monkey named Poppy, Isotopia and Poppy were simple beings with simple tastes and lifestyle. They lived in a small, simply furnished house. On the same island, there also lived a Unicorn who had a unique ability to fly very high and far. The only dream of Isotopia was that someday, she would ride on the Unicorn. One day, Isotopia was alone at home, and Poppy had gone to eat some bananas. When he climbed a banana tree and started eating, he saw that the Unicorn was standing below. He was looking at him. Poppy was not an ordinary monkey. He was very wise and could understand the language of every animal on the island. He dropped down some bananas to the Unicorn also, and said, “Would you allow me to ride on your back someday?”The Unicorn replied, “You have fed me tasty fruits. You can surely ride on me.” Poppy was exhilarated! He jumped on the Unicorn’s back, and the Unicorn flew high up in the sky. Poppy enjoyed it very much. When the Unicorn landed down, Poppy said, “Thanks for the ride. I had never imagined how different an experience this would be!
